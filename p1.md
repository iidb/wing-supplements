## `LSMTest.SuperVersionTest` timeout

The autograder is configured to allow at most 100 user processes, but the last test case of `LSMTest.SuperVersionTest` attempts to create 500 threads so it fails, and somehow it falls back to single thread mode. To reproduce this behavior locally and optimize your code, you can `ulimit -u 100` and then run gtest normally.
